# Codility Solutions

Here I am going to commit my solutions for Codility Lections, written in Python 3.6.
I focus on getting maximum score of those tasks (correctness, error resistance etc).
I don't say that those solutions are the shortest, fastest and mainly the best. But I hope that they would be useful.
