# Codility Solutions

Here I am going to commit my solutions for Codility Lessons. I will start with Python 3.6, and hopefully with another languages like C in the future.
I focus on getting maximum score of those tasks (correctness, error resistance etc).
If I don't write otherwise, commited solutions have 100% score.
I don't say that those solutions are the shortest, fastest and mainly the best. But I hope that they would be useful.
